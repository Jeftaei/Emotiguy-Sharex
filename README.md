# Notes
A few things to note are the names of the files, most of them were not named after the original discord emote for the emotiguys servers, they were named whatever the image was or the emote id, there are too many for me to change manually and I am lazy so it might stay this way until someone else fixes it, a few i went through and saved as specific names

I tried to include as many images as I could and kept out most of the images without transparent backgrounds or the low quality ones but I added a few I think look good.

I feel I should mention I made none of these credits go to anyone who put watermarks on the images and the people from the emotiguy servers who I stole images from without asking.
