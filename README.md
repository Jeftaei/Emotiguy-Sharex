# Emotiguy-Sharex
Sharex image effect for emotiguy

1. Download the Emotiguy folder in this repository, or alternatively from the [mega link](https://mega.nz/folder/ncQWyK6K#8tQ-FygmUxt_f3MVhNp4ZQ) I recommend the mega as it is more likly to be up to date (new includes alot of videos so file size is quite a bit bigger, emotiguy-old is ~350 images while the newest is ~510)
2. Download the sharex image effect (Emotiguy.sxie) and double click it to open with sharex
3. Find the "ImageFolder" field in the effect settings and set it to the folder with emotiguy images in it
4. Press close and enable the image effect if not already enabled (after capture tasks -> Add Image Effects)
